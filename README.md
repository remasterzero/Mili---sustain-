[Verse 1]
If abstraction is the definition of beauty
Are those of us chasing after clarity
A representation of ugly?

[Pre-Chorus]
Call me mommy
Just like your fantasy
There is no crime in ideality
Mux demux
Can't you understand me?
I'm not mine NAND I'm not yours
Ah

[Chorus]
This could end right here if you don't let it out
Let it out
Give up or give me your all
Tell me now
Tell me now
